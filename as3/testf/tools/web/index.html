		<h1>Welcome to TestF</h1>
		<p>TestF is an Open Source benchmark for Flash devices running Flash Player 10.1, AIR 2.5 or higher.</p>
		<p>Its aim is putting Flash devices to the test, highlighting strengths and weaknesess. Which one has more raw CPU power. Which one has better access to disk. Which one has better hardware acceleration. And so on.</p>
		<p>You can <a href="0.1/">run the test now</a>, but please read below some considerations:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Close all other applications and background processes first, you don't want other apps interfering the benchmark.</li>
			<li>Connect your device to a power source, many turn down CPU cycles when on battery.</li>
			<li>The test will deliberately push the device to its limit, so expect some screen tearing, freezes, fans spinning, etc.</li>
			<li>There are big differences between running Flash apps within AIR vs. standalone vs. within the browser.</li>
			<li>There is a huge difference between using a debug vs. release version of the player.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>TestF is Open Source, you can get the source code in <a href="#">Github</a>. Anybody is more than welcome to provide new tests or improve the current ones, just have a read to the <a href="#">docs</a>.</p>
		<p>Please <a href="#">get in touch</a> for ideas, patches, new tests, etc.</p>
